# bonescss

bonescss is a bare-bones CSS framework. It provides tools that enable you to focus
on the awesome parts of CSS.

- make use of [smacss](https://smacss.com/) namespaced class-names by default
- all the [h5bp](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/) CSS defaults are there and up to date
- 100% BEM compatible
- Bootstrap mode that generates ready to use classess

Unlike Compass or Bourbon, bonescss is not meant to provide mixins for bower compatibility.
[autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) does that job very well.


##Installation
There are two ways to install it:

1. add `node_modules` to your SCSS directories then `npm install bonescss --save-dev`, then `@include` the individual files in your SCSS files
2. Or checkout this repository into your SCSS directory and use it as a boilerplate: `git clone https://github.com/meodai/bonescss.git your-scss-directory`

##Usage
You can add it to your existing SASS setup and make use
of all the mixins and helpers or you can let it generate helper classes in boilerplate mode.

1. Using only the mixins on your own classes.
  -  all you have to include is `0.setting` and `mixins`
  -  adapt the different `0.setting`'s file to your project.
2. Use it in as boilerplate with placeholder selectors or classes.
  - include and adapt `main.scss`
  - adapt the differet `0.setting`'s file to your project.

## 1.base
Contains the part H5BP's main.css before [`Author's custom styles`](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/src/css/main.css)

## 2.layout
All rules inside this file are prefixed with `.l-` and `%l-` but you can overwrite this variable `$layout-selectors: "%l-" ".l-";`

- **.l-clearfix** (@mixin clearfix)
  h5bp's [cleafix](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/src/css/main.css#L171)

- **.l-size-width** (@mixin site-witdh)
  Used as a class for containers. Sets the with of the design and centers it. (Also set it to position relative)

- **.l-horizontal-list** (@mixin horizontal)
  Makes a `UL` or `OL` list display horizontally

- **.l-horizontal** (@mixin horizontal($childSelector: '*'))
  Does the same then `.l-horizontal-list` but for every element.

- **.l-horizontal-samewidth-list** (@mixin horizontal($type: samewidth))
  Uses table layout to make a list that is horizontal where the total with of the list is divided by the number of children.

- **.l-horizontal-equidistant (@mixin horizontal($type: equidistant, $childSelector: '*'))**
  Every element inside this container will have equal distances in between.

- **.l-table, .l-table-row, .l-table-cell** (@mixin table, table-row, table-cell)
  Used for table layouts. Because yes sometimes I use them.
  `.l-table-cell` comes with a modifier `.l-table-cell--max` and `.l-table-cell--min`. `.l-table-cell--min` Is always as wide as its contents. and `.l-table-cell--max` as wide as possible inside the table layout.

  Floats all children right and the first one left. Also extends `.l-clearfix`.

- **.l-fill** (@mixin fill)
  Uses `position:absolute` and fills its context.

- **.l-centered**
  Used for a CSS only modal-box. Will always be centered, scrollable and will have the size of its content. Works in all cool browsers and IE8+. in order to Make it work you have to use the following DOM structure:

  - `.centered`
    - `.centered-container`
      - `.centered-inner`
        - `.centered-content`
          - `.centered-body`

  If you don't need to support uncool browser is suggest you use the mixin `center-absolute()`.

- **@mixin center-absolute($direction:both|horizontal|vertical)**
   Absolutely centers an element in it's parent horizontal, vertically or in both directions

## 3.helpers
The helpers are mostly text helpers. This is why the rules are prefixed with `%t-` and `.t-`, this can be changed by overwriting: `$text-selectors: "%t-" ".t-";`

- **.t-selectable, .t-not-selectable**
  Will set `user-select: none;` or `user-select: text;`.

- **[.t-antialiased](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11459746/css3-webfont-smoothing-and-antialiasing-in-firefox-and-opera)** (@mixin antialiased)

  Will [truncate text](http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/truncate-string-with-ellipsis/) using overflow ellipsis.

- **@mixin smoothscroll** ($axis:y/x)
  Will make the overflow-y or x play nice on IOS.
  ```
  overflow-y: scroll;
  -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;

## 5.states
In SMACSS states are prefixed with `.is-` but here as well you can modify this with:

  $state-selectors: "%is-" ".is-";
  $state-selectors-and: "&%is-" "&.is-";

- **.is-visuallyhidden** & **.is-visuallyhidden-focusable** (@mixin visuallyhidden, @mixin visuallyhidden-focusable)

  Hide visually and from screen readers, but maintain layout

- **.is-disabled** (@mixin disabled)

- **.is-hidden** (@mixin hidden)
  Hide visually and from screen readers: [H5BP](h5bp.com/u)

- **.is-visible** (@mixin visible)
  Used to show elements. Will set to inherit by default, but can be block inline or inline-block as well just use the modifiers `--block`, `--inline` or `--inline-block`.

- **.is-loading**
  Generic loading class. Will make elements with this class pulsate.

## _mixins.scss
Includes all the mixins and functions

### Size / Metrics

- **@mixin px2percent ($size,$contextSize)**
  Converts any size into percents. If in some PSD file your design is 1024px wide and some sidebar in this design has a width of 300px you would use the function like this:
  `width: px2percent(300px,1024px)`

- **@mixin px2rel($px, $baseSize, $unit)**
  Will convert any pixel unit to a relative unit. Usually used to convert font-sizes.
  If for example your `h1` should have a font-size of 40px and your base font-size is 16px. The function would be used as such: `font-size: px2rel(40px, 16px)`
  The default unit will be `rem` you can set it to something else (like EM) by using the third argument. If you set $s-font-base in your options somewhere you don't have to pass the second argument.

- **@mixin font-size($px)**
  Sets a font size with a PX fallback for old browsers
  `font-size: font-size(16px)`
  will result in
  ```
  font-size: 16px;
  font-size: 1rem:
  ```

- **line-height($px)**
  Set a line-height with a PX fallback exactly as the font-size function

### Shapes
- **triangle( $height, $color, $direction, $width )**
  Creates a CSS triagnle using the [border trick.](http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/css-triangle/) if `$width` is not set it will be the same as the height.

- **circle( $size, $color )**
  Make a circle of a given color using border radius
